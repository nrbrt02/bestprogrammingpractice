## Q1.
In programming, **logging** refers to the process of recording __events, actions, or messages__ that occur during the execution of a program.
These log messages are typically stored in __a log file or sent to a logging service for monitoring, debugging, or analysis purposes__.

## Q2.
Logging is a critical component of software development and maintenance for several reasons:

**Debugging:** Logs are essential for diagnosing and fixing issues in software. Developers can use log messages to trace the flow of execution, identify errors, and understand the state of the program at a particular point in time.
**Monitoring:** Logs provide visibility into the behavior of a program in production. By analyzing log data, developers and system administrators can monitor performance, track usage patterns, and detect anomalies or security breaches.
**Auditing:** Logging can be used to record important events for auditing and compliance purposes. For example, logging user actions in an application can help track user behavior and ensure accountability.
**Performance Analysis:** Logs can be used to analyze the performance of a system by tracking metrics such as response times, resource usage, and error rates. This information can help identify bottlenecks and optimize the performance of the software.

## Q3.

|**Level**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|ALL|All levels including custom levels.|
|DEBUG|Designates fine-grained informational events that are most useful to debug an application.|
|INFO|Designates informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at coarse-grained level.|
|WARN|Designates potentially harmful situations.|
|ERROR|Designates error events that might still allow the application to continue running.|
|FATAL|Designates very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.|
|OFF|The highest possible rank and is intended to turn off logging.|
|TRACE|Designates finer-grained informational events than the DEBUG.|
